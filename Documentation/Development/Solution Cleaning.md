Solution Cleaning
-----------------

.NET Core projects include bin and obj folders which contain project asset artifacts. These artifacts can accumulate as the solution migrates through different .NET SDK versions, they are not source code and can be generated by the solution itself. 
Visual Studio and Rider can remove artifacts from the bin folders, but not the obj folders.

To cleanup after migrating to a new .NET SDK version - run the bellow commands which will recursively scan for and remove the bin and obj folders and their contents.

WARNING: Run these commands from the /Nautilus/Source/ directory otherwise it will destroy the OS.

As good practice test which files and folders will be deleted first;

	sudo find -type d -name bin -exec ls {} \;
	sudo find -type d -name obj -exec ls {} \;
	

If you are happy with the listed files and folders to be recursively removed, then execute the below;

	sudo find -type d -name bin -exec rm -rf {} \;
	sudo find -type d -name obj -exec rm -rf {} \;
